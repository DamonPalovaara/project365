# Yooper Astrophotography

## The Problem
The website https://www.cleardarksky.com/ doesn't have many locations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It's possible to make a request for new locations but I don't know how long it will take or if they'll be approved. I'm also not a huge fan of the website look.

## The Solution
The goal of this project is to create an astrophotography map of the U.P.
